### ❌ Critical Missing Features

#### 1. **Report Persistence** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Issue**: Reports are generated but NOT saved to database
- **Impact**: Reports lost on refresh, no history
- **Files**: `app/financial-playground/page.tsx:531` (handleReportComplete)
- **Fix**: Implement proper save logic to `reports` table

#### 2. **Section-Wise Loading** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Expected**: Reports load section-by-section with visual progress
- **Current**: Single streaming blob
- **Classic API**: `/api/playground/reports/[reportId]/sections/`
- **Missing**:
  - Section creation API calls
  - Progressive section display
  - Section order management
  - Individual section loading animations

#### 3. **Real-time Token Counter & Cost** 🟡 IMPORTANT
- **Expected**: Live token count and cost display above report (like classic)
- **Current**: No visible token/cost tracking
- **Classic Location**: Above report panel
- **Needs**:
  - Token streaming from API
  - Cost calculation display
  - Running total UI component

#### 4. **Generate Report / Add to Report Buttons** 🟡 IMPORTANT
- **Expected**:
  - "Generate Report" button after chatting
  - "Add to Report" to append to existing report
- **Current**: Auto-generates after every message (wasteful)
- **User Flow Issue**: Can't chat without triggering generation

#### 5. **Context Feature** 🟡 IMPORTANT
- **Expected**: View compressed context for threads/reports
- **Classic APIs**:
  - `/api/playground/threads/[threadId]/context-markdown`

- **Missing**:
  - Edit mode toggle
  - Section edit capability
  - Suggestions panel
  - Save edited content

#### 7. **Auto-Load Latest Thread** 🟢 NICE TO HAVE
- **Expected**: Opening playground loads most recent thread
- **Current**: Shows empty state
- **Note**: Previous attempts caused infinite loops

#### 8. **Thread Summary in Sidebar** 🟢 NICE TO HAVE
- **Expected**:
  - Auto-generated summary text
  - Message count badge
  - Last message preview
- **Current**: Just shows thread title

#### 9. **Entity Extraction & Display** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Working**: EntityBar component exists
- **Missing**:
  - Entities not saved to database
  - Entity click → detail view not working
  - Entity aggregation service not running

#### 10. **Report Sections Management** ❌ MISSING
- **Expected**: Add/remove/reorder sections
- **Classic APIs**: Full CRUD for sections
- **Missing**: Section management UI
