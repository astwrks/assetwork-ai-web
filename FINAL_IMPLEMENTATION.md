### Complete Flow

#### Generating New Report:
```
1. User types: "Analyze Tesla"
2. Message appears in CENTER panel
3. RIGHT panel auto-opens
4. Report streams to RIGHT panel in real-time
5. User sees HTML report building live
6. On complete: Report SAVES to database (playground_reports table)
7. Report persists in right panel
```

#### Loading Existing Thread:
```
1. User clicks thread from LEFT panel
2. CENTER loads all messages
3. RIGHT panel fetches and shows saved report
4. If no report exists: Auto-generates one
5. Everything persists!
```

### Persistence Implementation

#### Report Save (NEW!):
```typescript
// When report completes:
1. POST /api/v2/reports
   - Saves to playground_reports table
   - Links to threadId
   - Stores htmlContent
   - Saves metadata (model, prompt, etc.)

2. Updates currentReport state
3. Report now persists across page reloads
```

#### Report Load:
```typescript
// When loading thread:
1. GET /api/v2/threads/:id
   - Returns thread, messages, AND report
   - Report comes from playground_reports join

2. loadThread() sets currentReport
3. Right panel displays it immediately
```

### Database Tables Used

- `threads` - Conversation threads
- `messages` - Chat messages
- `playground_reports` - Generated reports (NEW USAGE!)
- `entity_mentions` - Extracted entities
- `system_prompts` - AI prompts (from DB)

- Header: Click chevron (‚Üê) to close
- Toolbar: Click chevron (‚Üí) to open

**Right Panel Toggle**:
